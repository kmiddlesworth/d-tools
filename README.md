d-tools
=======
g-sheets is a comprehensive tool for converting google spreadsheets into json objects.

recursive features include:
empty cell cleaning,
object grouping,
array grouping,
partial injection

I see g-sheets being built out as a library for web devs to use with a google spreadsheet that is created by a pm or content manager.

The reason I see it as a library is because in order to allow the user (in this case the pm or webmaster) to have complete autonomy in their sheet creation methodologies, and the developer, to mirror the way that the sheet is build, such that the pm can create and configure their google spreadsheets however they see fit, and the developer can create the processes methodology to reflect the user's habits / tendancies and overall style.

The main reason it needs to develop into a library is so that it can be applied to any sheet structure, made by anyone, and consequently, the same structure can be reflected, however the dev wants and needs it to be reflected for their particular template, though, usually, both will be fairly reflective of one another.

There is no perfect way for a developer to catch all of the intricacies of a sheet, and subsequently the individual creating said sheet, but they can definitely try. I hope this library can become an avenue through which they can try, and can make the process as clean, and easy as possible.
